    <strong>About Me</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>I am currently a freshman at Gonzaga University, studying Biomedical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/school-of-engineering-applied-science" target="_blank">Gonzaga School of Engineering and Applied Science.</a> I am originally from Arizona, but I am excited to spend the next four years here in the wonderful city of Spokane.
    
    My goal for this page is that it gives you a breif introduction to who I am.

  <strong>Hobbies</strong>
</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Photography</h4><p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography. I've tried to try many different styled to see what fits me the best, so I have some projects with sports, nature, portraiture, or more edit-heavy style photography.
  You can check out some of my portfolios on my Flickr site up at the top, and some of my personal favorite ones are under this</p>

  <li><h4>Reading</h4><p>
   I spend much of my free time reading books, mostly in fantasy or science fiction genres, though I do enjoy some thriller, historical fiction, and psychology genres every once in a while. Some books I've been reading recently/would recommend are <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199698485-the-god-of-the-woods" target="_blank"><em>The God of the Woods</em></a>,
  
   <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002132-oathbringer" target="_blank"><em>Oathbringer</em></a>, and
   
   <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41886271-the-sword-of-kaigen" target="_blank"><em>The Sword of Kaigen</em></a>.   
  </p></li>
  <br>

  <li><h4>Getting Outside</h4><p>I enjoy getting outside and active. My main sport is tennis, though I like to play pickleball, table tennis, and go swimming as well. I also love to go out into nature, which I have learned to savor growing up in Arizona, with not too much green around me. Most recently I went camping in <em>Olympic National Park</em> and at the <em>Blossom Lakes</em> in Montana.</p>

  <strong>Experience</strong>
</h2>
<ul>

    </li>
<br>

  <li><strong>Volunteering</strong>
  <p>I have around 80 hours of tutoring volunteer service at my high school called The Ignatian Project. It was four weeks of summer school, where I acted as an older buddy to a pair of kids going into second grade, and helped them get prepared for their next school year. It was a great time, and it showed me how rewarding and fun working with kids can be.</p>
    </li>
  <li><strong>American Society of Civil Engineers Club</strong>
  <p>I joined the Gonzaga chapter of ASCE earlier this year, and so far, it has been my main club i've focused on. We work to build a concrete canoe from scratch that we will race against other school next semester. I am the photography lead of the club as well as helping work on the canoe, and I try to capture the activities and extensive process that is put into building this canoe.</p>
